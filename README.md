# Challenge Scenario

We've made a few changes to the Contacts app after receiving feedback from our (imaginary) users. Our users said they would like to have the following features added:

- The ability to add an emergency contact
- The ability to add a relationship for each contact
- Assurance that the relationship for each contact is always normalized

We asked one of our devs to make these changes while being hung upside down, blindfolded, and tickled voraciously. Oddly enough, this did not result in their best work, and the Contacts app is now broken. For this challenge, we'd like you to do the following:

1) Fix the existing bugs that were accidentally implemented so the app works again
2) Code your own solution for normalizing and validating the contact relationship field data

We don't expect you to have any instant fixes, and you can feel free to ask us questions throughout. What we're most interested in seeing is your thought process and workflowâ€”how do you go about identifying and solving a problem? Please feel free to use any online resources you would normally refer to, such as Google, StackOverflow, etc. (there's no such thing as cheating for this challenge).
